# Timer

## Structure
```console
.
├── build
│   ├── bin
│   └── cmake
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── driver.c
├── include
│   └── foo.h
├── run.sh
└── src
    └── foo.c
```

## Commands
<b>Note</b>: I personally renamed <ins>run.sh</ins> to <ins>run</ins> because it's easier to use.
```console
$ ./run [build/make]
$ ./run rebuild
$ ./run clean
$ ./run
```
Make sure to set the <ins>run.sh</ins> file to be executable.
```console
$ chmod +x run
```

### ./run make/build :
Both do the same thing. 
<br>They run CMakeList.txt and then the Makefile generated by CMake.
```console 
$ ./run make
$ ./run build
```

### ./run rebuild :
Deletes previously generated files and then runs CMake and Make
```console
$ ./run rebuild
```

### ./run clean :
Removes the <ins>build/</ins> directory.
```console 
$ ./run clean
```

### ./run :
If there is binary executable inside of <ins>build/bin</ins> it will run it. If there isn't, it will build, make, and then run.
```console
$ ./run
```
You can also pass in any command line argument into main!
```console
$ ./run <arg1> <arg2> <...>
```

<br><b>Note:</b> the <ins>project</ins> name and <ins>binary executable</ins> name are hardcoded.
1. run.sh : $project (line no. <b>3</b>)
2. CmakeLists.txt : $REPO (line no. <b>4</b>)
